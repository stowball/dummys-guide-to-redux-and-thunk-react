# A Dummy's Guide to Redux and Thunk in React

The demo app for my blog post, updated use stateless components and work with React 16 and React-Redux 7. It is not an example of writing best-practice markup or React JavaScript, it's just the bare minimum to demonstrate how to use Redux and Redux Thunk.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= v4 must be installed.

## Installation

- Running `npm install` in the app's root directory will install everything you need for development.

## Development Server

- `npm start` will run the app's development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot module reloading.

## Building

- `npm run build` creates a production build by default.

   To create a development build, set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development` while running this command.

- `npm run clean` will delete built resources.
